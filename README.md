# ownCloud SMS

ownCloud SMS provides a webinterface to display your SMS conversations. SMS conversations are pushed by your Android devices using the [Android client](https://github.com/nerzhul/ownCloud-SMS-App), available on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.unix_experience.owncloud_sms).

## :arrow_forward: Access

The app is available in both, [Nextcloud appstore](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/ocsms) and [ownCloud appstore](https://apps.owncloud.com/content/show.php/ownCloud+SMS?content=167289). So installing is as easy as

1. Navigate in your Nextcloud / ownCloud instance to the "apps"
2. Enable "experimental apps" in the settings
3. Select the category "Multimedia"
4. Click "activate"
