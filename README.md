# Phone Sync (for NextCloud & ownCloud)

Phone Sync provides a webinterface to display your SMS conversations. SMS conversations are pushed by your Android devices using the [Android client](https://github.com/nerzhul/ownCloud-SMS-App), available on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.unix_experience.owncloud_sms).

## :arrow_forward: Access

The app is available in both, [Nextcloud appstore](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/ocsms) and [ownCloud appstore](https://apps.owncloud.com/content/show.php/ownCloud+SMS?content=167289). So installing is as easy as

1. Navigate in your Nextcloud / ownCloud instance to the "apps"
2. Enable "experimental apps" in the settings
3. Select the category "Multimedia"
4. Click "activate"

If you are on MySQL or MariaDB and have issues with the databse, the cause may be that you have to enable 4-byte support. Here is a guide: https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/11/admin_manual/maintenance/mysql_4byte_support.html
